Example repository demonstrating Solano CI docker pull, build, test, and push. When configured
it will also deploy to AWS EC2 Container Service (ECS). See the upcoming
http://blog.solanolabs.com/ blog post for more information.

Technologies used:

- Docker
- AWS EC2 Container Service (ECS)
- Nginx
- Mysql (only used for example purposes. Many "lighter" solutions would be more appropriate in this use case.)
